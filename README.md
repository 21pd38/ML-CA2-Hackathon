Topic : Spam/Ham classification with visualizations

Abstract : 
SecureInbox Pro is an advanced email filtering system designed to enhance user experience by efficiently classifying incoming messages as either legitimate (ham) or unwanted (spam). Leveraging five powerful machine learning models – K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, SVM Linear, SVM RBF, and Logistic Regression – the system employs a comprehensive approach to accurately categorize emails.
It aims to not only enhance email security but also streamline the user's email management experience. By combining the power of multiple machine learning models and an intuitive interface, this solution provides an effective and visually appealing approach to spam/ham classification in email communication.
